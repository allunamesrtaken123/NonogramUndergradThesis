# NonogramUndergradThesis

This repository is the companion to my undergraduate thesis, which can be found here [link doesn't work yet](www.bit.ly/1EqAdIp). All of the final versions of the files used for the thesis are included, organized by the chapter in which the code or its output is discussed. Additionally, the LaTeX code necessary to compile my thesis is included. 

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, reach out to me at [afoote@wesleyan.edu](mailto:afoote@wesleyan.edu?subject=NonogramUndergradThesisRepo).
